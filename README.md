<ul>
  <li>Practicing building an maintaining code.</li>
  <li>Getting more comfortable with data management and data sharing throughout the application via redux.</li>
  <li>Getting more comfortable with handling rest API's such as axois and handling database requests</li> 
  <li>Learning more about how to test the applications for bugs and erros and learning how to build components in way that avoid bugs</li>
