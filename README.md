# Goals

Taking on this project has been an invaluable journey, allowing me to elevate my mobile development skills and providing insights into the intricate process of building a full-scale application. The primary benefits derived from this experience include:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Practical Code Building and Maintenance:</strong> This project provided extensive hands-on experience in constructing and maintaining code. This practice not only refined my coding skills but also instilled a sense of discipline in code organization and structure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proficiency in Data Management and Sharing with Redux:</strong> One of the key takeaways was the enhanced proficiency in managing and sharing data across the application through the implementation of Redux. This not only streamlined the flow of information but also contributed to a more organized and efficient development process.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Improvement in Hadnling REST API:</strong> Working with REST APIs, particularly through libraries like Axios, became second nature. Handling database requests seamlessly integrated into the workflow, opening up opportunities to interact with and manipulate data efficiently.
  </li> 
  <li>
    <strong>Improvement in Application Testing:</strong> A significant aspect of the learning curve involved understanding and implementing effective testing methodologies. This encompassed identifying and resolving bugs, building components with a bug-resistant design, and ensuring the robustness of the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encounter with Real-world Challenges:</strong> The project introduced me to a realm of real-world errors and bugs that are often concealed until confronted in the context of a full-scale application. This exposure proved instrumental in honing my troubleshooting skills and developing a proactive approach to problem-solving.
